## Project Objective
This project aims to extract insights from the **AMCAT** dataset. It focuses on identifying current trends, finding patterns, and helping students analyze career choices based on their skills and demographic information.

## Dataset Summary
- **Total Data Points**: ~4000
- **Independent Variables**: ~40
  - Includes continuous variables (e.g., salary scores) and categorical variables (e.g., gender, specialization).

### Key Areas of Focus
1. **Employment Outcomes**: Salary, job titles, and job locations.
2. **Skills Assessment**: Standardized scores in cognitive, technical, and personality skills.
3. **Demographic Information**: Gender, college tier, state, etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Process

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Checking dataset shape and data types.
- Handling missing values and renaming columns.

### 2. Data Manipulation
- Dropping unnecessary columns.
- Adjusting data types as needed.

### 3. Univariate Analysis
- **Non-visual Analysis**: Statistical exploration of variables.
- **Visual Analysis**: Representing data through graphs (e.g., salary distribution).

### 4. Bivariate Analysis
- Exploring relationships between two variables using statistical and visual methods.
- Analysis of continuous numerical data vs. discrete data.

## Research Questions
The analysis addresses research questions designed to uncover significant insights for guiding career decisions and skill assessment.

## Visual Data Representation
Various charts and graphs are used to illustrate key findings throughout the presentation.

## Project Goal
By analyzing the AMCAT dataset, the project provides a comprehensive guide for students to better understand their strengths and align their career choices accordingly.
